## 📦 Installation
1. Open the `.dmg` file.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
If your monitor brightness does not change or the monitor acts strangely:

Use the **physical buttons** on your monitor to open its menu and check these settings. These features often **block** software control:
- **Eco Saving Plus**: Must be **OFF**.
- **Magic Bright / Samsung MagicBright**: Set to **Custom** or **Standard**.
- **Auto Source Switching**: Try turning **OFF**.

### 2. Monitor Locked Up?
If your monitor stops responding completely:
1. Unplug the monitor's **power cable** for 30 seconds.
2. Plug it back in.
   *(Restarting your Mac is often not enough to reset a crashed monitor controller).*
